nodemon package is used to restart our app.
npm i nodemon -D 
always instal as dev dependencies.

in script of json file we can write commands.
for e.g. 
"start":"node app.js"
in terminal we can write 'npm start' and it will run the node app.js command.
but some command require 'npm run' command, such as.
"dev":"nodemon app.js"
this will run when we run this command in the terminal.
'npm run dev'

either this or we can simple write, start : nodemon app.js and in terminal npm start.

uninstall package - npm uninstall 'package name'

nuclear approach - delete the node modules and the package.lock.json file and remove it from dependencies then we run terminal with command npm install.
